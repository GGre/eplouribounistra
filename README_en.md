# Collaborative WebApp to manage serials deduplication in libraries.

Save space by eliminating duplicates, provide better readability of your collections by restoring for each of them a unique collection as clean as possible resulting from the aggregation of scattered items available in your libraries.

# Method:

For a given resource (Catalog Unit without filiations), "eplouribousse" allows libraries, each in turn, to indicate its bound elements contributing to the resulting collection, then in a second cycle of instructions and according to the same logic, its not bound complementary elements.

The order of processing is significant: The first library is normally the one already holding the most important collection (the one that claims conservation in the event that the collection is finally grouped). It is the same logic of importance that must prevail normally for the place claimed by the following libraries. It may happen that a library wants to subtract its collection to the reconstitution of the resultant (The typical case is that of a collection of the legal deposit) The positioning module of "eplouribousse" makes this derogation possible.

The sheets obtained describe the resulting collection ; the eliminated elements are deduced from this description (all that doesn't contribute to the resulting collection) The elements which contributes to the resulting collection may be grouped together or not, as desired. Physical treatments and catalog updates are expected.

# How to get eplouribousse?

In order to have an idea of what it turns about and what it looks, we first recommand to take a tour on a real instance https://eplouribousse-droit.di.unistra.fr/

----------------

It looks good ? Let's try it on your desktop with the Django development server (ensure Django is installed) ; this will allow you to test all features (except automatic mail alert which is just a convenience)

Download all the stuff here : https://github.com/GGre/eplouribounistra and put it in a directory of your own, then download this specimen database (eplouribousse.db) https://seafile.unistra.fr/f/d4c87784317d47a0ae1a/?dl=1 extract and put it in the directory where you find manage.py
(A look into this database should allow you to know how to craft your own one)

Open a terminal, change directory (you must go to the one containing manage.py) then write and valid the following command line : export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=eplouribousse.settings.dev

and run development server : python manage.py runserver (or eventually : python3 manage.py runserver)

Then you can play !

For any authentication use first name as identifier and testeplou as temporary password (the same for all identifiers)

This is a playground with three libraries : John works for Swallow library, Susan for Magpie library, Petra for Raven library, Clara is the checker, Flora is the database administrator, Alan is the site administrator and you are Joyce the super user. Discover what they can do, which rights they have, how they can interact with the app.

----------------

You're OK and you want the real one with all the conveniences ?
We recommend that you first approach your IT team for a test installation.

If you want to use eplouribousse for a firm project, there are three possibilities at the moment :
- Entrust the deployment to your IT department by indicating the address of this site
- Entrust the deployment to a host indicating the address of this site
- We entrust the deployment (subject to agreement)

In all cases, let us know that you're interested (see contact below)
